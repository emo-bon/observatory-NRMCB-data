The site is object of monthly genomic diversity sampling since 2019 (www.nerea-observatory.org) and sporadically also in the past. We observe two recurrent phytoplankton blooms, in the spring and in the fall. Pico/Micro phytoplankton blooms are also observed in other periods, such as Synechochoccus in July and picoeukaryotes all year around, generally after rain events. Heterotrophic bacteria also show sporadic peaks after rains.The NEREA Observatory also has 2 other sampling points, visited seasonally, at the Sarno river and close to the island of Capri, at a deep site (800 m). The LTER site encompasses the whole Gulf of Naples and it includes a benthic site in the island of Ischia.",Raffaella Casotti,raffaella.casotti@szn.it,https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9876-4601
